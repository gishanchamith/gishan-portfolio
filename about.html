        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Gishan Chamith, a first-year undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, passionate about engineering and physics. I ranked 65th all-island and
             3rd in Kegalle district in the 2022 Advanced Level examination.
             I’m also actively involved in leadership roles, having worked with AIESEC, the IEEE Student Branch, and the Buddhist Society at my university.
            Beyond academics, I enjoy mentoring students in physics, organizing events, and exploring software development. I’ve contributed to projects like SecureConnect 
            and am currently working on a website for O/L students in Sri Lanka.
            <br>
            I believe in continuous learning, teamwork, and making a positive impact, whether through volunteering, tech projects, or community-driven initiatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> St. Mary's College, Kegalle | University of Moratuwa</p>
        <p><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and problem-solving.</p>
